Hi for anyone who is reading this 🧑🏻‍💻

My name is Yongye, and I am a sophomore at the University of Amherst majoring in Computer
Science and Mathematics, concentrated on mathematical computing and modeling. I am actively learning a few 
programming languages, such as Python. I am also looking forward to learn Machine Learning, Mobile App Development on my 
own. I will give myself a short bootcamp on C++ since I will be taking OS next semester. 

- 🐍 I am currently working on a 100 days of coding challenge on Python (I am at Day 36 as I am writting this post)
- 👀 Semester Goals: Planning to learn Swift for Fall 2022 and Javascript if time permitted. I also wanted to complete 
at least one ML Project using libraries like scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Network X.
- Personal interests: cooking, biking, watching movies, thinking about life. 
- Something I am proud of doing this month is I have designed an API -- using Python and Flask -- where the user can use communicate with the Router as it generates a list of trips by connecting different delivery stops. API documentaion will soon be out and the API will be deployed with AWS. 
- Something I am working on: a chatbot that is used by any user on WhatsApp through the service of Twillio to ask the information of their trips. 
                          - chat bot is done, will deply next week
