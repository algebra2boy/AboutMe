Hi for anyone who is reading this 🧑🏻‍💻

My name is Yongye, and I am a sophomore at the University of Amherst majoring in Computer
Science and Mathematics, concentrated on mathematical computing and modeling. I am actively learning a few 
programming languages, such as Python. I am also looking forward to learn Machine Learning, Mobile App Development on my 
own. 

- 🐍 I am currently working on a 100 days of coding challenge on Python (I am at Day 23 as I am writting this post)
- 👀 Semester Goals: Planning to learn Swift for Fall 2022 and Javascript if time permitted. I also wanted to complete 
at least one ML Project using libraries like scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Numpy.
- Personal interests: cooking, biking, watching movies, thinking about life.
