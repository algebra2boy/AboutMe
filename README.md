Hi for anyone who is reading this 🧑🏻‍💻

My name is Yongye, a sophomore at the University of Amherst majoring in Computer
Science and Mathematics, concentrated on mathematical computing and modeling. I am actively learning a few 
programming languages, such as Python and Swift. My specialization is software development and iOS mobile app development.

- 🐍 I am currently working on a 100 days of coding challenge on Python (I am at Day 36 as I am writting this post)
- 👀 Semester Goals: learn Swift for Fall 2022 and Javascript if time permitted. I am thinking to design and develope
an "Lost and Found" App that helps users to report and search for their lost items on Xcode with Swift. 
- Personal interests: cooking, biking, watching movies, enjoying food. 
- Something I am proud of doing this month is I am working on a flashcard app that allows users to study in a productive and fun way, and it will be soon deployed, which everyone can download it on their iPhone.
